## Building

The environment to build the docs is within a Docker container managed

2. `docker compose up -d` will start the container
3. Use any tool to get a prompt within the running container,
   e.g. `docker exec -ti jekyll bash`
4. `cd dp.docs` to enter into the `docs` folder mounted into the container

## Testing

1. Build the container
2. Get a prompt in the container's `/dp.docs/docs` folder
3. Start a local webserver on port 4000 with `bundle exec jekyll serve`
4. Use your browser and tools to view and test the content
