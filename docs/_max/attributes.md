Our plugins support a normal compliment of Max and Jitter attributes like
`hidden`, `color`, `varname`, etc. They also support additional feature
attributes specific to our plugins.

The dumpout outlet follows normal Max conventions.

Below is a *combined* list of feature attributes for *all* our Max plugins.
All plugins do not support all feature attributes.

* Attribute documentation pages list supported plugins :electric_plug: at the top.
* Click a plugin name in this documentation or the navigation menu. The plugin
  page lists all supported feature attributes.
* Max Inspector lists attributes for any plugin selected in a Max patch.
