Our plugins support the normal compliment of Max and Jitter methods with
messages like `getattributes`, `summary`, `getstate`, etc. They also
support additional feature methods specific to our plugins.

Send methods to the first inlet of the plugin.
The dumpout outlet follows normal Max conventions.

Below is a *combined* list of feature methods for *all* our Max plugins.
All plugins do not support all feature methods.

* Method documentation pages list supported plugins :electric_plug: at the top.
* Click a plugin name in this documentation or the navigation menu. The plugin
  page lists all supported feature methods.
* Right-click on the plugin's inlet in your Max patch. Max will list all methods for that plugin.
