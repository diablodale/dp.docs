  signature: "{ auto | EXPOSURE_NUM } [{auto | ISO_INTEGER }]"
  values:
    "auto": automatic color exposure and iso (default)
    "[1..5000000]": specific exposure, automatic iso
    "[1..5000000] [100..1600]": specific exposure, specific iso
  examples:
    - "@colorexposure auto        <- automatic exposure and iso"
    - "@colorexposure 16666       <- 16.6ms exposure, auto iso"
    - "@colorexposure 16666 auto  <- 16.6ms exposure, auto iso"
    - "@colorexposure 16666 800   <- 16.6ms exposure, 800 iso"

Color exposure in microseconds (Âµs) and ISO sensitivity.

Each sensor model may have different exposure and ISO ranges.
Newer sensors and plugins usually have more flexible ranges.

* `auto` is the default; exposure and ISO is automatically chosen.
* `[1..5000000]` exposure is the length of time the color sensor
  receives light to create one frame. Time is measured in
  microseconds, except for [dp.kinect](#dpkinect).
* `[100..1600]` ISO is the sensitivity to light of the color sensor.

## dp.kinect

[`dp.kinect`](../../dp.kinect/) uses the old attribute `@exposure`
to set color exposure time. The default is automatic color exposure.
To set a specific color exposure, disable automatic color exposure
and then set the exposure, e.g. `@autoexposure 0 @exposure 166`.

Exposure time is measured in units of 1/10000 second. Therefore,
`@autoexposure 0 @exposure 166.6` is a 16.66 millisecond exposure.
The range of possible exposure units is `[1.0..4000.0]`.
