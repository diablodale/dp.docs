  signature: "{ auto | EXPOSURE_INT } [{auto | ISO_INTEGER }]"
  values:
    "auto": automatic mono exposure and iso (default)
    "[1..5000000]": specific exposure, automatic iso
    "[1..5000000] [100..1600]": specific exposure, specific iso
  examples:
    - "@monoexposure auto        <- automatic exposure and iso"
    - "@monoexposure 16666       <- 16.6ms exposure, auto iso"
    - "@monoexposure 16666 auto  <- 16.6ms exposure, auto iso"
    - "@monoexposure 16666 800   <- 16.6ms exposure, 800 iso"

Monochrome camera exposure in microseconds (Âµs) and ISO sensitivity.

Each sensor model may have different exposure and ISO ranges.
Newer sensors and plugins usually have more flexible ranges.

* `auto` is the default; exposure and ISO is automatically chosen.
* `[1..5000000]` exposure is the length of time the monochrome camera
  receives light to create one frame.
* `[100..1600]` ISO is the sensitivity to light of the monochrome camera.
